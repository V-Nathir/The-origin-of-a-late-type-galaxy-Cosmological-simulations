# Tools for analyzing cosmological simulations

The data of a AP3M-SPH cosmological simulation has been analyzed to find the origin of the components of a late-type galaxy using Python.

This is my Master's Thesis in the Astrophysic field for the Universidad Complutense de Madrid. This project is divided in these tasks  : 

- Create a software to read and save the raw data given in Big Endian from the simulation, converting it into a simpler format. 

- Develope a code that can calculate and plot :
